# Project instructions

## Ownership
Dirthara owns this package. Attribute copyright, licensing, and authorship to `Dirthara` rather than to an individual
maintainer. The MIT `LICENSE` reads `Copyright (c) <year> Dirthara`, and new files or documents that name an owner
use the same name.

## Branching
Every supported version has its own branch; there is no `main`. Target a feature at the newest release branch and a fix
at the earliest supported branch that has the bug, then forward-merge upward. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before
branching, merging, or releasing.

## Committing
Never run `git commit`, `git push`, `git tag`, or anything else that writes to history or to the remote. Stage nothing
and commit nothing: the maintainer commits and pushes every change themselves. Leave the work in the working tree
and say what is ready.

## Tests
Line coverage of `src` must stay at 100%; `composer coverage` fails below it and lists the uncovered lines. Add tests
in `tests` with every implementation change.

## Development
Use the PHP container for Composer and PHP commands; see [README.md](README.md). Use the `Dirthara\Session`
namespace for source and `Dirthara\Session\Tests` for tests. Declare strict types in every PHP file.
This package needs no database, so its image and `compose.yaml` carry none of the template's database drivers or
services.

## Language
Write everything in British English: names, messages, comments, documentation, and commit messages. Read and follow
https://github.com/dirthara/coding-standards/blob/main/docs/coding-standards/cs-2-naming-conventions.md#3-language for
names fixed by PHP, dependencies, or tools.

## Comments
Write no prose comments in code, configuration, scripts, or workflows by default. Make what something does clear through
names and structure instead, and never add a comment that narrates the code or restates a rule from the coding
standards. Add a prose comment only for a strong reason the code cannot carry: a non-obvious why, such as an external
constraint, a tool's behaviour, or a deliberate trade-off, or how to run a script. Keep the existing comments; each has
such a reason. Comments a tool reads, such as type annotations, `@throws`, suppression pragmas, the version comment on a
pinned action, and the template markers like `@database`, are always allowed.

## Characters
Write no invisible characters: no trailing whitespace, tabs where the file indents with spaces, non-breaking or other
non-ASCII spaces, zero-width characters, byte order marks, or bidirectional control characters. End every file with a
single newline.

## Exceptions
Read and follow https://github.com/dirthara/coding-standards/blob/main/docs/coding-standards/cs-7-exceptions-error-handling.md when creating or modifying exceptions.
Every exception implements `Dirthara\Session\Exception\SessionException` and uses the
`HasExceptionContext` trait for its context.

## Documentation
Read and follow https://github.com/dirthara/coding-standards/blob/main/docs/coding-standards/cs-6-documentation.md when writing the README or anything in `docs`.

## Packaging
Read and follow https://github.com/dirthara/coding-standards/blob/main/docs/coding-standards/cs-8-packaging.md when
changing what a release contains, the actions the CI workflow uses, or the dependency update configuration.

## Coding Standards
Read and follow all coding standards in https://github.com/dirthara/coding-standards (https://github.com/dirthara/coding-standards/tree/main/docs/coding-standards).
