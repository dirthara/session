# Dirthara Session

Sessions for PHP and the Dirthara framework: a session manager with sliding expiry, ID regeneration, storage
contracts, and an in-memory driver.

Usage guides and API documentation live in [`docs`](docs/intro.md), starting with
[getting started](docs/getting-started.md). They are published on the Dirthara documentation site at
<https://dirthara.github.io/docs/>, which documents every package in the framework.

## Installation

Requires PHP `^8.5` (PHP 8.5 or a later PHP 8 release). Composer installs the runtime dependency, `psr/clock`.
Install with:

```sh
composer require dirthara/session
```

## Docker development environment

Requires Docker with Docker Compose. The development image provides PHP 8.5 CLI, Composer 2.10.3, Mago 1.47.3, and
Xdebug.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dirthara/session.git
cd session
LOCAL_UID=$(id -u) LOCAL_GID=$(id -g) docker compose up -d --build php
docker compose exec php composer install
```

The container runs as the non-root `developer` user. The build arguments `LOCAL_UID` and `LOCAL_GID` default to 1000;
the command above uses your host IDs so generated files remain editable. Set `PHP_VERSION` to override the default
8.5 image. Rebuild when the Dockerfile or build arguments change.

Open a shell or stop the environment with:

```sh
docker compose exec php bash
docker compose down
```

## Tests

```sh
docker compose exec php composer test
```

Tests belong in `tests`, under `Dirthara\Session\Tests`. Source belongs in `src`, under `Dirthara\Session`.

The unit suite covers the implementation and its failure handling.

## Code quality

Run the same checks as CI:

```sh
docker compose exec php composer ci
```

Run individual checks:

```sh
docker compose exec php composer fmt-check
docker compose exec php composer lint
docker compose exec php composer analyze
docker compose exec php composer guard
```

`composer mago` runs the formatting, import-order, lint, analysis, and configured architecture checks. `composer ci`
also runs tooling tests, unit tests, and the coverage gate.

Apply formatting and import sorting with `composer fmt`, or include automatic lint fixes with `composer cs`:

```sh
docker compose exec php composer fmt
docker compose exec php composer cs
```

`composer cs` includes potentially unsafe lint fixes; review its changes.

Run coverage separately with:

```sh
docker compose exec php composer test-coverage
docker compose exec php composer coverage
```

Xdebug is inactive by default and enabled for the coverage run. The report is written to `build/coverage/clover.xml`.
The gate requires 100% line coverage of `src` and lists uncovered lines.
